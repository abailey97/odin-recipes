    <h2>description</h2>
<p>Braised short ribs are a popular dish made by slow-cooking beef ribs in a flavorful liquid until they are tender and falling off the bone. The ribs are typically seared or browned in a pan before being added to a mixture of aromatics (such as onions, garlic, and carrots) and liquid (such as beef stock, red wine, or tomato sauce) in a covered pot or Dutch oven. The mixture is then simmered on the stove or in the oven for several hours until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded together. The resulting dish is often served with mashed potatoes, polenta, or a crusty bread to soak up the flavorful sauce. Braised short ribs are a hearty and satisfying comfort food that are perfect for cooler weather or special occasions.</p>
