    <h2>description</h2>
    <p> ribeye steak is a type of steak that is cut from the rib section of a cow. It is a heavily marbled cut of beef, which means it has visible flecks or streaks of fat running throughout the meat. The marbling helps to keep the steak tender and juicy during cooking, as the fat melts and infuses the meat with flavor. When cooked properly, a ribeye steak should have a crispy, caramelized exterior and a juicy, pink or red center that is slightly marbled with fat. It is a flavorful and rich cut of meat that is best enjoyed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</p>
